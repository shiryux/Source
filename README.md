Modified version of SphereServer emulator for Ultima Online.
Support will not be provided. Code will be customized.

## Coding notes for new contributors
* Make sure you can compile and run the program before pushing a commit.
* Rebasing instead of pulling the project is a better practice to avoid unnecessary "merge branch master" commits.
* Removing/Changing/Adding anything that was working in one way for years should be followed by an ini setting if the changes cannot be replicated from script to keep some backwards compatibility.
